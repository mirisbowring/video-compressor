# Video Compressor  
This tool is created for windows operating systems.  
By default, it takes every MP4 file from the input folder and compresses it (using the x264 or x265 script) into the equivalent output directory.  
  
### Configuration  
If you want to compile other video formats like flv, you need to change the regex in the script.
